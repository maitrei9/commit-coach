â”œâ”€â”€ analyzers/             # Commit analysis modules
â”œâ”€â”€ config/                # Configuration handling
â”œâ”€â”€ core/                  # Core functionality

â””â”€â”€ types/                 # TypeScript type definitions
```

### Code Style

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow the existing code style and patterns
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Keep functions small and focused

### Commit Messages

We follow conventional commit format:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

Examples:
```
feat(analyzers): add semantic commit analyzer
fix(github): handle missing PR context
docs(readme): update installation instructions
```

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm run test

# Run tests with coverage
pnpm run test:coverage

# Run specific test file
pnpm test src/analyzers/semantic.test.ts
```

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for new functionality
- Aim for good test coverage
- Use descriptive test names
- Test both success and error cases
- Mock external dependencies

### Test Structure

```typescript
describe('Feature Name', () => {
  describe('when condition is met', () => {
    it('should behave correctly', () => {
      // Test implementation
    });
  });
});
```

## Submitting Changes

### Issue Guidelines

Before submitting a pull request, please:

1. Check if an issue already exists for your feature/bug
2. If not, create an issue to discuss the change
3. Use the appropriate issue template (bug report or feature request)

### Pull Request Guidelines

1. **Create a descriptive title** that clearly explains what the PR does
2. **Link to related issues** using "Fixes #123" or "Related to #123"
3. **Provide a clear description** of what changes were made and why
4. **Include tests** for new functionality
5. **Update documentation** if needed
6. **Ensure all checks pass** (tests, linting, formatting)

### PR Template

We use a pull request template to ensure consistency. Please fill out all relevant sections.

### Review Process

1. Automated checks must pass (CI, tests, linting)
2. At least one maintainer review is required
3. Address any feedback from reviewers
4. Maintainers will merge when ready

## Release Process

Releases are automated using GitHub Actions:

1. Version bumps are handled automatically
2. Changelog is generated from conventional commits
3. GitHub releases are created automatically
4. npm packages are published automatically

### Versioning

We follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):
- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes
- **MINOR**: New features (backward compatible)
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes (backward compatible)

## Development Workflow

### Branch Naming

- `feature/description` - New features
- `fix/description` - Bug fixes
- `docs/description` - Documentation updates
- `refactor/description` - Code refactoring
- `test/description` - Test improvements
